    <h1>Semiconductor</h1>
    <h2>Solids can divides into two catogery:</h2>
        <p>
            <h3>1.Crystalline solid:</h3>
            <br><br>
            Those solids in which the particals are arranged in regular manner periodic 3d lattices
            and they sharp melting point and ex: nacl, diamond etc. and it shows property of anisotropic nature means direction dependent and have ahard and rigid and have a seven crystal systems and cutting with knife also ex: quartz, zns etc.

            <br><br>
            <h3>2. Amorphous solids:</h3>
            <br>
            Those solids in which partical are arranged in irregular manner  in a 3d  lattic and they have not a sharp melting point and ex: g;ass , plastic, rubber etc. and it shows isotropic property and nature is soft , do not have crystal system.
            <br><br>
            <h3>3. Polycrystalline solids:</h3>
            <br><br>
            It is  a type of crystalline solid and they are made up grains which are seprated by given boundaries . grains are randomly oriented with each other. ex: most of metals , cermaic etc.
            <br><br>
            <h3>4. 3D space lattice:</h3>
            <br><br>
            In three dimensional regular arrangement of points describing the arrangement of particles has identical surroundings.
             <br><br> 
            <h3>5. Basis:</h3>
             <br><br> 
             May be a single atom or group of atoms, ions or molecules which when attached to every lattice point a crystal structure is formed.
             <br><br>
            <h3>6. Crystal structure :</h3>
            <br><br>
            When space lattice  and basis joint together it forms a crystal structure i.e : 
            <br><br>
            <h3>space lattice + basis = crystal structure</h3>
            <br><br>
            <h2>Unit cell:</h2>
            <br><br>
            Unit cell is the smallest unit of crystal structure which when reapted again and again  in different direction in space from the crystal structure.
            <br><br>
           <h3> Primitive cell:</h3>
            <br><br>
            It is a type of unit cell in which lattice points are present at corners of the unit cell .
        <br><br>
           <h3> Lattice parameters:</h3>
            <br><br>
            1) Edges:
            <br>
            2) Crystallographic axis:
            <br>
            3) Interfacial angles:
            <br><br>
           <h3> The shape of unit cell depends on parameters known as lattice parameters.</h3>
            <br><br>
            1) The intercept of unit cell in x,y,z direction is called edges of the unit.
            <br><br>
            2) The imaginary lines drawn parallel to the lines of the edges knows as crystallographic. 
            <br><br>
            3)The angle between crystallographic axis knows as interfacial angles.
            <br><br>
            <h2>Bravis lattice in 2D: </h2>
            1) Square lattice :  a=b , angle=90
            <br>
            2) Rectangular lattice :  a!=b  , angle=90
            <br>
            3) Obliqe lattice :  a!=b  , angle!=90 
            <br>
            4) Rhombus lattice :  a=b  , angle!=90
            <br>
            5) Hexagonal lattice :  a=b,  anhle=60
            <br><br>
